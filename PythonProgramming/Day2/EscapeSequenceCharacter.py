#An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

#The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:

print("We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.")

print("Hello\nWorld!")
print("Hello \bCode!")

#Other escape characters used in Python:
'''
\'	Single Quote	
\\	Backslash	
\n	New Line	
\r	Carriage Return	
\t	Tab	
\b	Backspace	
'''
